# vim-remarkjs
Generate slideshows from markdown with [remark.js](https://github.com/gnab/remark).

A simple plugin that provides a `:RemarkPreview` command to generate html that displays as a nice slideshow in your browser.

If [vim gogo](https://github.com/idbrii/vim-gogo) is installed, `:RemarkPreview` launches the html in your browser.
